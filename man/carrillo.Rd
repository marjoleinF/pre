\description{
Dataset from a study by Carrillo et al. (2001), who assessed the extent to 
which the subscales of the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI; Costa and 
McCrae 1985) could predict depressive symptomatology, as measured by the 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, and Carbin 1988). The NEO-PI 
assesses five major personality dimensions (Neuroticism, Extraversion, 
Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness). Each of these
dimensions consist of six specific subtraits (facets). The NEO-PI and BDI 
were administered to 112 Spanish respondents. Respondents' age in years and 
sex were also recorded and included in the dataset.
